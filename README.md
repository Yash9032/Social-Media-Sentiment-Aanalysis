# Social Media Sentiment Analytics â€“ Internship Project at Brainwave Matrix Solution

This project was developed as part of my internship at Brainwave Matrix Solution, where I built a complete sentiment analysis pipeline using Python and an interactive Power BI dashboard to analyze social media data from platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and X.com (formerly Twitter).

# Project Objectives

Analyze and visualize social media sentiment across platforms.
Extract insights from user engagement, hashtags, and geographical trends.
Build an end-to-end NLP pipeline for sentiment scoring.

# Sentiment Analysis Pipeline (Python)

Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Used Pandas and NLTK to clean text data.
Sentiment Scoring: Applied VADER for sentiment classification (positive, neutral, negative).

# Visualization:

WordCloud for frequent keyword extraction.
Matplotlib and Seaborn for sentiment distribution and trends.

# Segmentation:

By platform, country, and popular hashtags

# Power BI Dashboard

Key Metrics: Avg Likes (43), Avg Retweets (22), Total Users (670)

Visual Elements:

Donut charts, bar graphs, sentiment filters.
Gauge charts and time series from 2010â€“2023.
Geo-mapping for country-wise engagement.
Top trending hashtags (e.g., #Yearning, #HuesOfSunset).
Highlighted trends in user behavior, sentiment shifts, and regional engagement.
